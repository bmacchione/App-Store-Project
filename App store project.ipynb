This indicates that it would be worthwhile to develop an app that allows for some sort of sharing or interacting with others.  The health and fitness categories also have a fairly large number of users in both the Google Play store and the Apple Store.  A lot of different conclusions can be drawn from this data, and it would honestly make sense to go in a number of different directions.  As an example though it would likely be profitable to develop a health and fitness app with the ability to share or maybe \"compete\" with friends and family so the app would have both the health and fitness and also the communication element combined."
