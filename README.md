# App-Store-Project
This is my frist attempt at using Python to clean and analyze data through a guided project on Dataquest.  This is also my first time using Jupyter noteboook.  So far it's really fun!
This is currently a work in progress and I'm doing my best to do this on my own therefore my code does not exactly match the posted solutions.  I'm assuming the posted code is simpler but for now I'm focusing on being able to write code that does what I intend it to do and then I will start to focus more on writing it in the simplest way possible.
